## [Liminoid](http://projectliminoid.wordpress.com/) | augmented and virtual experience of disintegrating subjectivity ##

Liminoid is written in Scala, and uses the LWJGL OpenGL library.

For Ubuntu you need to install the Oculus Rift SDK (0.2.5 used here), and these packages: 

    sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk libopencv-dev arduino arduino-core

You also need [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/), then just `sbt run` from your terminal.

Docs, resources, compiled versions, etc. will be made available later, also check the [website](http://projectliminoid.wordpress.com/).
