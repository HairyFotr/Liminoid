    Sensors calibration (visual(javacv) or magnetometer(jrift)?)
    Circular opening up on center-stare 
  1
    Position rocks onto the center sphere
    Encourage user to face center during radiolarian opening
      could use: sound, fade out if looking around, slow down cam movement
    Where are the frames 5400 - 6480?
    Sound and fadein to heartbeat 
  2
    Pulse sensor filtering or close average instead of direct input
  3
    Disintegration and reintegration
      Check it
      Video saving (see keyboard)
        Save into random folder, add to load file - last entry wins
      Abstract Sequence and Camera, so they can be swapped around as needed
        Is this more than a common get, and maybe blobdiff?
  4
    Thread network with Liminal being nodes
    Liminal being transformation
  5
    Fly rock

// General tasks:
/// mouse replaces rift sensor, if missing
/// split setup / rendering, as to get rid of lazy vals, and things like that
/// check things for frame dependence instead of time dependence
/// check for resolution dependence (especially 2D, I think)
/// some things belong in config files (which?)
//// make camera id config and/or autodetect
/// am I deleting all used textures? (camera?)
/// why is so much stuff in Arduino synchronized?
/// make oscillator/fade/... library

SOME NOTES
  prehod med fazami
  setup -> heartbeat works, rift view is forward, images preloaded ->
  radiolarians -> radiolarian comes close, opens, black screen ->
  mandalas -> the whole thing plays ->
  backspace ->

  refactor
    start opengl, then go onto app -> get rid of some false lazy loading
  optimizations, ideas, ...
    preload images while fps >= 60
  details
    call camtex when switching to a camera phase
    menger sponge feathered texture on radiolarians!!!

  Cameras
    Front camera (Logitech c270)
      Bus 003 Device 013: ID 046d:0825 Logitech, Inc. Webcam C270
      Focus hacking http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-gYgBeiOVI

      one camera  - move image for each eye [Done]
      two cameras - figure out the spacing, FOV, etc

    Back camera (Logitech c615)

    Take a few frames before showing
      prevents user from seeing
        old frames

        brightness adjusting

  Libraries
    I've compiled a custom lib rift, that skips display detection (and then lost it?)
    opencv has its own libpng, that isn't compatible with ubuntu 14.04 libpng
